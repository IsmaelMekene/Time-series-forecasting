## Subject

The file Elec-train.xlsx ([dataset](https://github.com/IsmaelMekene/Time-series-forecasting/blob/main/dataset/Elec-train.xlsx)) contains electricity consumption (kW) and outdoor air temperature for one building.

These quantities are measured every 15 minutes, from 1/1/2010 1:15 to 2/16/2010 23:45. In addition, outdoor
air temperature are available for 2/17/2010. The goal is to forecast electricity consumption (kW) for
2/17/2010.

Two forecasts should be returned, in one Excel file entitled YourName.xlsx, with two columns (one columns
per forecast) and 96 rows:

1. the first one without using outdoor temperature,
2. the second one using outdoor temperature.

Of course, the goal is to get the best possible forecasting.
